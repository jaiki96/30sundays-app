// ─── Everything a couple wants to know before they accept a hotel ───
//
// The old hotel page carried a name, a star count, one rating and a strip of
// photos. That is not enough to decide on, so people were leaving the app to
// look the same hotel up on booking.com or Google, and half of them did not
// come back. This file is the answer to "what would they have gone looking
// for": the photos grouped by what they show, the room detail, the facilities
// in full, the neighbourhood, the policies, the questions people actually ask,
// and ratings from every source we have rather than one borrowed number.
//
// It is written as one complete hotel rather than a generator, because the
// point of the screen is depth. A generator that fills 40 fields with plausible
// noise proves nothing about whether the page reads well.

import { SAMPLE_VIDEO } from "./videoSource";

// ─── Where a rating or a review came from ───
//
// We show our own score next to booking.com's and Google's instead of
// borrowing one of theirs, because our couples rate a stay on things a
// business traveller does not: whether the room was worth the honeymoon, how
// the staff handled a surprise. Every number on the screen is badged, so
// nobody has to guess whose opinion they are reading.

  reviewSummary: {
    text: "Almost everyone who writes about this hotel writes about the pool. It comes up in a third of the reviews, usually alongside the fact that the resort is adults only, which is what keeps it quiet enough to swim laps at six in the morning. Breakfast and the staff are the next two things people single out, and several travellers mention that the team remembered their names by the second day. Rooms are described as spotless, and the two minute walk to the beach comes up again and again as the reason to pick this stretch of Seminyak.\n\nThe complaints are consistent and small. Drinks at the rooftop bar are priced for tourists, several people say so. A few note that the sea in front has a strong current from the early afternoon and is not always swimmable, which surprises people who booked for the beach. And a handful of guests in the upper ocean suites mention the sun arriving at six in the morning if the blackout curtains are left open.",
