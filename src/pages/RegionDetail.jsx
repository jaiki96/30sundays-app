// who has already been.
//
// The shape is the day detail screen's. Each region is a card in a deck you
// push sideways, with the next region peeking in at the edge so the gesture is
// visible rather than guessed at. Scrolling a card lifts its sheet over the
// footage and the card grows out to the full screen as it goes, which is how
// the same surface is both a thing you browse and a thing you read.

// stepping between regions already has two better doors, the destination
// screen and Pair with at the foot of this page.

// is a flight. Somebody who has never been to Vietnam asks something simpler
// first: can I fly there, and from where. Hoi An has no airport, Da Nang's is
// half an hour up the road, and nothing from India lands at either.
//
// So the origins start in India and carry on into the country, in one row,
// because they are all answers to the same question and a caption over each
// half was two labels doing the work of an order.
//
// Each way is a line you read left to right: the places, with the plane or the
// boat or the car between them. No words for the modes, no times per leg, no
// summary of what you are about to look at. The journey is the answer and the
// only number on it is how long the whole thing takes.

// four-stop journey stays a line rather than a paragraph.

// ─── Where to stay ───

// Two questions, and neither of them is which part of town. The page answers
// that everywhere else: the map says where the region is, Pair with says what
// is next to it, and the honest bit says whether the beach is any good. What a
// couple genuinely cannot work out for themselves is what kind of place to book
// here and which room in it is worth paying up for, so that is what this says.
//
// The advice and the hotels are one answer, so they sit in one block rather
// than a card with a rail underneath it. Two surfaces read as two sections, and
// "what kind of hotel" followed by "here are the hotels" is plainly a single
// thought.
//
// White, like every other card on the page. It was a pink and cream wash, which
// is a lot of brand colour to put behind three paragraphs of body text; the
// pink earns more by being only the two icons and the bullets.
//
// Both halves used to open with an icon in a tinted well, which pushed the
// words into a column two thirds of the width and left a tall strip of nothing
// down the left of the block. The wells are gone. The advice is the only thing
// in here, so it gets the full width, and the room names are a plain list of
// the three worth asking about rather than three cards with a line of reasoning
// under each.
